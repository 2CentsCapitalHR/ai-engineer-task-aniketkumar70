## üîß Usage Guide

### Step 1: Upload Documents

1. Click the "üìÅ Upload Legal Documents" area
2. Select one or more DOCX or PDF files
3. Supported file types: `.docx`, `.pdf`

### Step 2: Analyze Documents

1. Click "üîç Analyze Documents" button
2. Wait for the analysis to complete (typically 30-60 seconds)
3. Review the results in two sections:
   - **Analysis Summary**: Quick overview with compliance scores
   - **Detailed JSON Report**: Complete analysis results

### Step 3: Review Results

The system provides:

- **Process Detection**: Automatically identified legal process
- **Document Completeness**: Percentage of required documents uploaded
- **Compliance Score**: Overall compliance rating (0-100)
- **Issues Breakdown**: Categorized by severity (High/Medium/Low)
- **Missing Documents**: List of required documents not yet uploaded
- **Annotated Files**: DOCX files with review comments added

### Step 4: Download Annotated Files

  - **Orange**: Medium severity issues
  - **Blue**: Low severity issues

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Customizing Reference Documents

Edit the `REFERENCE_FILES` dictionary in the code to point to your reference documents:

```python
REFERENCE_FILES = {
    'checklist_1': '/path/to/your/ADGM_CHECKLIST_2.pdf',
    'employment_2024': '/path/to/your/employment_contract.docx',
    # Add more as needed
}
```

### Adjusting Analysis Parameters

Key parameters can be modified:

```python
# Compliance scoring weights
FIELD_SCORE_WEIGHT = 70    # Weight for required fields
JURISDICTION_SCORE = 20    # Weight for jurisdiction compliance
GOVERNING_LAW_SCORE = 10   # Weight for governing law

# RAG search parameters
RAG_TOP_K = 5             # Number of relevant chunks to retrieve
RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.3  # Minimum relevance score
```

### Adding New Document Types

Extend the `DOCUMENT_TYPES` dictionary:

```python
DOCUMENT_TYPES["new_document_type"] = {
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"],
    "weight": 1.0
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Built-in Tests

Uncomment and run the test function:

```python
test_system_with_sample_documents()
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Test with sample employment contract**:
   - Upload an employment contract DOCX
   - Verify it's detected as "employment_contract"
   - Check for missing required fields

2. **Test with corporate documents**:
   - Upload Articles of Association
   - Verify process detection as "Company Incorporation"
   - Review compliance issues

3. **Test completeness checking**:
   - Upload partial document set
   - Verify missing documents are correctly identified

4. **Data Protection**: GDPR/data protection compliance

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No files uploaded" error**
   - Ensure files are properly selected before clicking analyze
   - Check file types are .docx or .pdf

2. **"RAG embeddings model failed to initialize"**
   - Check internet connection
   - Restart the application
   - Use keyword search fallback (automatic)

3. **"Error processing document"**
   - Ensure DOCX files are not corrupted
   - Try converting PDF to DOCX for better analysis
   - Check file permissions

4. **Low compliance scores**
   - Review detailed issues in the JSON report
   - Check annotated DOCX files for specific problems
   - Ensure correct document type is being analyzed

### Performance Issues

1. **Slow analysis**
   - Large files take longer to process
   - Multiple files increase processing time
   - Consider upgrading to GPU-enabled environment

2. **Memory issues**
   - Close other applications
   - Process fewer files at once
   - Use smaller reference document set

### Getting Help

1. **Check the detailed JSON report** for specific error messages
2. **Review the console output** in Jupyter notebook for technical errors
3. **Verify file integrity** by opening documents manually
4. **Test with minimal document set** to isolate issues

## üîí Security & Privacy
